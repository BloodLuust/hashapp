# Security Policy

We welcome vulnerability reports and responsible disclosure. Thank you for helping keep users safe.

## Supported Versions

## Safe Harbor
We will not initiate legal action for good‑faith, accidental violations of this policy. Please:

- Initial assessment: ≤ 10 business days  
- Fix & coordinated disclosure: within 90 days, or mutually agreed

## Out of Scope
- Social engineering against maintainers or users
- Physical attacks
- Issues requiring privileged/insider access
- Denial‑of‑service (traffic floods) without a specific root cause
- Findings that rely on outdated browsers or OSes beyond vendor support

## Scope of Testing
- Testnet and watch‑only flows are encouraged
- Do **not** attempt sweeping or broadcasting from others’ wallets
- Do **not** exfiltrate private keys or sensitive personal data

## Contact Preferences
Please use encrypted channels when possible. We can provide an alternative inbox upon request.
