## Purpose, Ethics & Safe Use

**Why this exists.**  
This project produces HD extended keys at high speed, surfaces only **valid hits** (addresses with transaction history and/or balance), and shows live progress. It is architected for **defensive** and **educational** workflows—wallet recovery research, incident response, and studying misuse patterns to strengthen ecosystem safety.

**Statistical reality.**  
The chance that a **random** private key corresponds to a **used** Bitcoin address is roughly **~10⁻⁴⁰**. The pipeline is engineered to be fast and thorough (gap‑limit lookahead, change‑chain coverage, recursive traversal), but **finding live funds from random keys is effectively impossible**. Treat this as **instrumentation**, not a money printer.
